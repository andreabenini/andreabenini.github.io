## Andrea Benini Personal Site

This is just a placeholder now, no content here (yet). I'd like to organize my projects and place static links from this site repo. Github doesn't provide dinamic content engines but at least it's fine for a static content site, I'll keep it as it is. Content below is just a mere copy from the default theme
